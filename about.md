<p class="message">
  This is the personal webpage of Maxime Turgeon, PhD candidate in Biostatistics at McGill University. My supervisors are <a href="http://greenwoodlab.github.io/">Dr. Celia Greenwood</a> and <a href="http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/Labbe/index.html">Dr. Aurélie Labbe</a>. I'm interested in dimension-reduction techniques, semiparametric statistics, and their application to statistical genetics.
