<p class="message">
  This is my personal webpage. I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/">University of Manitoba</a>. This is a joint position between the <a href="https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/statistics/">Department of Statistics</a> and the <a href="https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/">Department of Computer Science</a>.
  
  My main research interests are dimension reduction methods for high-dimensional data. This includes linear approaches (e.g. PCA, CCA, PCEV, PLS) as well as nonlinear approaches (e.g. manifold learning, autoencoders). I am interested in developing statistical methodologies that are statistically and computationally efficient. I am also interested in applications to statistical genetics, genomics, and neuroimaging.
  
  I have a PhD in Biostatistics from McGill University. My supervisors were <a href="https://greenwoodlab.github.io/">Dr. Celia Greenwood</a> and <a href="https://chairesd.hec.ca/en/">Dr. Aur√©lie Labbe</a>. The title of my PhD thesis was <i>Dimension Reduction and High-Dimensional Data: Estimation and Inference with Application to Genomics and Neuroimaging</i>.
