### R packages

 - ```pcev```: PCEV is a dimension-reduction technique, similar to Principal components Analysis (PCA), which seeks to maximize the proportion of variance (in the response vector) being explained by a set of covariates. The R package implements two estimation methods: the classical approach and a block approach, proposed by Turgeon et al. (submitted), which is suitable for high-dimensional response vectors. The package also performs inference using both analytic and permutation tests. A stable version is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcev/), and the development version is on [Github](https://github.com/GreenwoodLab/pcev). For more information, have a look at the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcev/vignettes/pcev.pdf)!

 - ```casebase```: A package whose main purpose is to fit smooth-in-time parametric hazard functions using case-base sampling (Hanley & Miettinen, 2009). This approach enables the user to fit a wide class of parametric hazard functions and, as a result, to get smooth estimates of absolute risks. The [website](http://sahirbhatnagar.com/casebase/) has several vignettes explaining how the package can be used.

 - ```multiKernel```: This package implements multivariate prediction using kernel-machine regression. It is still very much in development on [Github](https://github.com/turgeonmaxime/multiKernel).
